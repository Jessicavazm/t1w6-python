## Programming language

- A language that writes programs for computers

## Program

- Set of instructions that computers know how to execute.
- Converts programming language commands/instructions in machine language.

## Python

Python is considered a high level programming language, that means python is closer to human language.

## Data types - These data types listed here are primitives data types.

Python has 15 types of data which includes
* Str ("Hello", "12341", "", ...) Strings are group of letters, as well as symbols, special characters and numbers - that makes up some context. Strings are always placed in single or double quotes.
* Booleans - this data input can only have one of the possible two values True or False, 1 or 0 (1= True, 0= False).

### Numbers
* Int - Integer or whole numbers. (1, 2, 0, -5, 123412, ...)
* Float - Floating point or decimal numbers ( Computer approximation of representing fractions ). (3.5, -4.12, .7.124124, ...)
* Complex - Imaginary numbers, you can make an imaginary number by adding a J to it.

### Variables

- Container for our piece of data
- Whenever we want that data, we can use the variable
- Variable values are subject to change


### REPL

- Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop
- You can open it typing " python3 " in your terminal, use "exit ()" to leave the REPL program (Don't rely on REPL as it does not have memory, every time you exit the program everything is erased).

### String Interpolation
The ability to insert Python expressions into our string.

### F String
